What is Phantom? 

The Phantom was a game console concept that never came to be... sort of. It was developed by a company known as Phantom Entertainment as a way to play video games for PC's without having to download them. The idea lives on in the modern era as cloud gaming. Many leading technology companies have adopted cloud gaming frameworks for their customer base. Each of these can in part trace its roots back to earlier interpretations of this tech, with the Phantom being one of the earlier examples. The Phantom game console however, never came to be.

The keyboards on the other hand are prolific. Phantom Entertainment released their keyboards for PC use. While in part as a way to ward off an FTC investigation, the product was interesting and functional. They're readily available on ebay and take up a ton of space. They're rotating, modular and still works alright on modern computers despite the age. 

What is this project? 

This project is a silly idea having taken a look at the unorthodox way the Phantom Lapboard software registered mouse and keyboard inputs in a practical case. The device is inaccurate at many times, due to old and deprecated 2.4 ghz wireless frequency range use. 

The project aims to integrate a more modern & universal ESP32 controlled bluetooth driver into the device at the hardware level. This would require a daughterboard, access to open source software for keyboard interpretation, a power supply unit, and a genuine Phantom Lapboard from 2004. 

What is the goal of this project? 

Much of the details are forthcoming, but the project should be able to provide a way to purchase components to either modify a phantom lapboard out of the box, with or without soldering effort. 

Can I contribute to this project? 

I will look into allowing project forks and a proper license for what is appropriate based on the tools I use. I will likely use the GPL V3 license for the software and provide information on all tools used in development. 

Further improvements can be made for mouse connectivity and support, which may require additional control boards to use. 

Is there an ETA on this project? 

No, this is a passion project, plain and simple. It's been under wraps as a concept for 6 months. If it gets any traction, this is where any updates will go.
